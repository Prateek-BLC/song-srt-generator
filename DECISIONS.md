# DECISIONS.md — Song SRT Generator V1

Source of truth for build decisions. Where this file and the build brief conflict, this file wins.
Recorded 2026-07-15 from Aman's answers.

## Section 2 answers

1. **Primary machine:** Aman's Mac — Apple M4 Pro, 48 GB RAM, macOS (Darwin 25.5). Build and test here. ffmpeg 8.1 and Python 3.10.5 already installed.
2. **Typical input files:** WAV and MP3 both expected (sample provided is 48 kHz stereo WAV). Accept mp3/wav/m4a/flac per brief.
3. **Lyric section tags:** Strip lines that are only a bracketed tag like `[Chorus]` (default on, checkbox in UI).
4. **Repeated choruses:** On-screen warning only when "x2"-style shorthand is detected. Never refuse to run.
5. **Whisper model:** `medium` via the **faster-whisper** backend of stable-ts. Checked Aman's machine: existing Whisper install is openai-whisper on Python 3.9 with vanilla `.pt` models (incl. large-v3) — different format, not reusable by faster-whisper, and large-v3 would be slower with no alignment-accuracy benefit. App downloads its own CT2 `medium` model once.
6. **Language:** English only for V1 (`LANGUAGE = "en"` in config). *Superseded by V3.4:* language is now picked per job.
7. **Vocal stem format:** WAV default (Aman: "WAV or MP3 or MPEG all fine" → keeping brief default WAV; switchable via `STEM_FORMAT` in config).
8. **Job retention:** Keep everything in `jobs/`, manual cleanup.
9. **Network:** localhost only (127.0.0.1:7860). LAN opt-in later via `HOST` constant.
10. **Length limits:** Warn > 10 min, refuse > 20 min (brief defaults confirmed).
11. **Sample:** `sample/clip.wav` (17 s, from Aman's "Hook Try.wav") + `sample/lyrics.txt` (2 lines, spoken vocal).
12. **Brief changes:** See stack changes below. Repo root is this folder (`Song to srt Generator/`), not a nested `song-srt-tool/`.

## Stack changes vs the brief (approved by Aman)

- **Aligner:** stable-ts `align()` kept (its forced-alignment API is still best-fit), but running on the **faster-whisper backend** (`load_faster_whisper`) for 2–4× speed. Note: stable-ts repo was archived May 2026 — versions are pinned; acceptable for a local offline tool.
- **Vocal separation:** platform-abstracted `separate_vocals()` interface instead of hard-coded Demucs.
  - **Apple Silicon (build target):** `mlx-audio-separator` (MLX / Apple GPU). **Benchmark result (M2, 17 s sample clip, M4 Pro): htdemucs separates in 1.9–2.0 s with instant model load; BS-RoFormer takes 6.9 s to separate and much longer to load. Alignment quality was perfect with htdemucs vocals. Locked: `htdemucs.yaml`.** RoFormer remains a one-line `SEPARATOR_MODEL` config swap if stem audio quality ever matters more than speed.
  - **Windows / Intel (future):** `audio-separator` package, same RoFormer model family → same output quality, CPU speed. Code path written defensively but **untested until Windows hardware is available**.
- **Compute:** CPU-only for alignment in V1 (no CUDA setup, no MPS for torch). Separation uses MLX GPU on Apple Silicon.

## Product/distribution decisions

- **V1 target: Mac only.** Windows support is a stated future requirement — keep the separator abstraction and installer platform-detection ready for it, but do not test on Windows now.
- **Eventually shipped as an installable zip:** unzip → run one installer script → it checks system (Python 3.10/3.11, ffmpeg), detects platform, installs the right dependency set into a venv, downloads models, runs `warmup.py` to PASS, creates start script. User prerequisite: Python installed (fully-bundled standalone app deferred to V2+).
- **Settings live in `config.py` only.** No settings panel in the app UI — UI stays upload → paste → generate.

## V2 additions (2026-07-15, after Aman's real-song test passed)

- **Video-format toggle** in the UI: "vertical" (9:16 Reels/TikTok) or "horizontal" (16:9 YouTube). One SRT per run, format chosen by the user (Aman's explicit decision — never generate both).
- **Single-line cues with hard character caps:** 25 chars vertical / 42 chars horizontal (research: Netflix 42 standard; ~25 recommended for 9:16 mobile). Caps are maximums, never minimums.
- **Splitting rules in priority order:** never merge across the user's lyric lines → a comma/full stop/`?`/`!` always ends the cue → over-cap runs split at the most balanced word boundary. Cue times come from word-level timestamps (stable-ts already produced them; no re-alignment needed).
- **Early-appear offset:** cues show 0.2 s before the vocal (karaoke practice), `EARLY_APPEAR_SECONDS` in config, clamped at 0.
- `cues.json` now stores per-cue word timings — groundwork for the future preview/nudge editor.
- Aman confirmed V1 output syncs "perfectly to the beat" on a real song before V2 was built.

## V3 additions (2026-07-15 — UI rebuild, Aman's decision)

- **Aman explicitly overrode the brief's "no React / Gradio only" rule.** New UI stack: FastAPI backend (`app.py`, same entry point) + React (Vite) frontend in `frontend/`, light editorial design with a dark-mode toggle. Gradio removed. `pipeline.py` untouched.
- Teammates never need Node: `frontend/dist` (built assets) is committed and served by FastAPI. Node is only needed to rebuild the frontend (`cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`).
- New UI features: waveform player (wavesurfer.js), live 3-stage progress rail, subtitle preview with click-to-seek (foundation for the future nudge editor), segmented format control, theme toggle (persisted).

## V3.1 — shippable release (2026-07-15, Aman's decisions)

- **Distribution: lite zip is the primary artifact** (~80 MB; models download during install). Aman's reasoning: the 2 GB downloads either way. `make_release.sh --full` can bake models in for offline installs.
- **Zero prerequisites for teammates:** the zip bundles `uv` (installs a private Python 3.10 into the folder) and static ffmpeg/ffprobe. Everything lives inside the app folder — `HF_HOME` is redirected into `models/hf`; deleting the folder uninstalls completely.
- User steps (updated 2026-10-29; the original "right-click `Install.command` → Open" step no longer works because macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned scripts): unzip → open Terminal, type `bash ` (with a space), drag `Install.command` into the window, press Enter → wait for PASS → double-click `Start.command`. Only the last step ever again (the installer strips the quarantine flags, so Start double-clicks cleanly). Fallback if a double-click was already blocked: System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway". The zip's `READ ME FIRST.txt` (generated by `make_release.sh`) and README.md carry the same steps.
- **Apple Silicon only at V3.1.** Windows/Intel installers were removed from the repo at this point (the `SEPARATOR_ENGINE="cpu"` code path in pipeline.py remained). *Superseded by V3.2:* a Windows x64 build (`install.bat` / `start.bat`) was added back. Intel Macs are still unsupported; `install.command` refuses non-arm64 machines.
- Developer install from a git checkout: `bin/` isn't committed, so run `./make_release.sh` once to fetch uv/ffmpeg, or follow the manual venv steps in CLAUDE.md §3.
- Quip decks persist in localStorage across runs; sentient lines never open a run (third rotation earliest).

## V3.2 — Windows build (2026-07-16)

- `make_release.sh <ver> --windows` builds `...-win-lite.zip` (x64): bundled uv.exe + gyan.dev static ffmpeg/ffprobe, Install.bat/Start.bat mirroring the Mac zero-prereq installer, config staged with `SEPARATOR_ENGINE = "cpu"`.
- **CPU path dress-rehearsed on macOS** with the exact Windows package set (`requirements-windows.txt`: audio-separator[cpu] + faster-whisper etc.) — full pipeline PASS, identical cues to the MLX path. htdemucs separation ~13 s for a 17 s clip on CPU.
- `requirements-windows.txt` is deliberately **unpinned** until the first successful install on real Windows hardware — pin exact versions after that test.
- **Status: UNTESTED on real Windows.** The .bat scripts and Windows-specific behaviors (SmartScreen, paths) need one teammate test run before this zip is considered shipped.

## V3.3 — fixes (2026-10-29)

- **`frontend/dist` is now actually committed.** V3 said it was, but the Vite-generated `frontend/.gitignore` ignored `dist`, so a fresh clone had no UI and `app.py` exited with "frontend/dist is missing". Removed that ignore line and committed the build. Rule: after any change under `frontend/src`, rebuild (`cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`) and commit `dist/` in the same commit. `package-lock.json` was re-synced at the same time (it had drifted from package.json, which made `npm ci` fail).
- **Separator model cached across jobs**, matching the align model. `pipeline._run_separator` keeps one Separator per `(SEPARATOR_ENGINE, SEPARATOR_MODEL)` and retargets `output_dir` on both the separator and its `model_instance` per job (both packages already swap these internally for chunked runs). Changing either config value reloads the model. Shared by the MLX and CPU paths.
  - **No real speed-up with the default `htdemucs.yaml`**, which already loads almost instantly (see the M2 benchmark). Measured 2026-10-29 on the 17 s sample, two jobs in one process: one model load, and separation took 2.85 s then 3.08 s. That ~3 s is the separation itself. The cache mainly pays off if `SEPARATOR_MODEL` is switched to a slower-loading model such as BS-RoFormer, so later jobs skip its load time.
- **Upload size limit:** `MAX_UPLOAD_MB = 500` in config.py (a 20-min 48 kHz 32-bit stereo WAV is ~460 MB, so anything the 20-minute rule accepts fits). Enforced twice in app.py: middleware rejects on `Content-Length` before the body is read, and a counted copy catches uploads without that header. Both return HTTP 413 with a plain message, and the UI now shows the server's error text instead of always saying "Couldn't reach the local server".
- **Finished jobs are evicted from memory** after `JOB_RETENTION_MINUTES = 120` (config.py), pruned whenever a new job is submitted. Only the in-memory entry goes, so the result's download links then 404. Job folders in `jobs/` are untouched (decision #8 stands).
- **Stricter "x2" detection** (decision #4 stays warning-only): the count must be 2–99 at the very end of a line, optionally bracketed (`Hold on x2`, `Chorus (x3)`, `[Chorus x2]`, `×2`). It no longer fires on `x1` or on mid-line text like `Malcolm x 3 times`. The check now runs *before* section-tag stripping, so a `[Chorus x2]` line warns rather than vanishing silently. Accepted miss: shorthand in the middle of a line (`Hold on x2 now`).
- **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md §3** no longer say the Windows installers were removed: they now point to `install.bat` / `requirements-windows.txt` (V3.2) and state that Intel Macs are unsupported.

## V3.4 — per-job lyrics language (2026-10-29)

- **Supersedes decision #6 (English only).** Users pick the lyrics language per job from a dropdown under the Vertical/Horizontal control instead of editing config.py. Offered: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Punjabi, Urdu (`config.LANGUAGES`, Whisper codes). `config.LANGUAGE` stays as the preselected default.
- `/api/meta` returns `languages` and `language_default`; `/api/jobs` takes a `language` field and silently falls back to the default if the code isn't in the list. `run_pipeline(language=...)` passes it to `align_lyrics()` and records it in `cues.json` and the job log's `Input:` line. CLI: `python pipeline.py <audio> <lyrics.txt> [vertical|horizontal] [code]`, extras in either order.
- The UI remembers the last pick in localStorage (`srt-language`), validated against the server's list on load.
- **Cue splitting:** the cue-ending punctuation now includes the Devanagari danda `।` `॥` and Urdu `۔` `،`, plus Urdu `؟` and `؛` (Arabic-script `?` and `;`, same role as the ASCII ones). A word opening with Spanish `¿` or `¡` starts a new cue.
- **Character caps (25/42) count what's displayed, not code points:** `_display_len()` skips combining marks (Unicode Mn/Mc/Me — Devanagari/Gurmukhi vowel signs, virama, nukta, anusvara) and joiners (Cf). Latin text counts exactly as before. Conjuncts like क्ष still count as two, which slightly over-counts and so stays safely under the cap.
- **Chinese, Japanese and Thai deliberately not offered:** they don't separate words with spaces, so the word-boundary splitter would produce bad cues. They need their own splitting first.
- Footer meta text changed from "English lyrics" to "Multi-language lyrics". The attribution line is untouched.
- Verified: warmup.py PASS (English, unchanged 4 cues); the sample run through the CLI with `es` recorded `"language": "es"` in cues.json and `language=es` in the log.

## V3.5 — Hinglish option (2026-10-29)

- **"Hinglish" added to the dropdown**, right after English and Hindi (order is now English, Hindi, Hinglish, then the rest; Hindi moved up from third to sit next to it). It's for Hindi lyrics written in Roman script.
- Whisper has no Hinglish code, so `config.LANGUAGE_ALIASES = {"hinglish": "en"}` maps the choice to the code used for alignment. `run_pipeline` resolves the alias; everything else (API validation, localStorage, CLI) treats `hinglish` as a normal choice.
- **Both are recorded:** `cues.json` has `"language"` (the choice, e.g. `"hinglish"`) and `"whisper_language"` (the code used, e.g. `"en"`); the job log's `Input:` line reads `language=hinglish (whisper code en)`. Non-alias choices record the same value in both.
- **Real-song test (Aman):** "Kabhi Kabhi Aditi" with Roman-script lyrics, aligned with English selected — timing was perfect. That is the basis for mapping Hinglish to `en` rather than `hi` (the Hindi model expects Devanagari text).
- CLI accepts `hinglish` like any other code. `frontend/dist` was rebuilt; the dropdown reads its list from `/api/meta`, so no frontend source change was needed.

## V3.6 — macOS app from GitHub Releases (2026-10-31)

- **Collaborators now get "Song SRT Generator.app"** (Apple Silicon) from GitHub Releases instead of the Terminal-installed folder. `./make_release.sh <ver>` builds `Song-SRT-Generator-<ver>-mac.zip` holding the .app and a `READ ME FIRST.txt`. `--windows` is unchanged; `--full` now bakes the models into the .app (copied to the data folder on first launch). `install.command` / `start.command` stay in the repo for running from a checkout, but no longer ship.
- **The bundle is read-only.** Code is in `Contents/Resources/app`, uv and static ffmpeg/ffprobe in `Contents/Resources/bin` (same sources as before). Everything writable lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Song SRT Generator/`: uv's Python 3.10, `venv/`, `models/` (`HF_HOME` too), `jobs/`, `uploads/`, `install.log`, `pycache/` (`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`, so nothing is written into the bundle) and the web view's storage. `pipeline.py` reads `SRT_DATA_DIR` for jobs/models (and app.py for uploads); unset, it falls back to the app folder, so checkouts and the Windows zip behave as before. Verified by launching a `chmod -R a-w` copy of the bundle.
- **Launch flow.** `Contents/MacOS/launcher` (bash) refuses Intel Macs, copies the bundled tools into the data folder's `bin/` and strips their quarantine flag there (the bundle can't be modified). On the very first launch it fetches Python plus pywebview (~40 MB, under a minute) behind a plain "Getting ready" dialog, because the progress window itself needs them. `Contents/Resources/launcher.py` then shows the progress window (`macapp/progress.html`): step 1 installs `requirements.txt` with uv, step 2 runs `warmup.py`, which must PASS. A failure shows the reason, a **Try again** button and **Show the log**. Success writes `installed.json` (version + hash of requirements.txt).
- **Updates reuse the data folder.** Setup re-runs only when `installed.json`'s version or requirements hash differs from the bundle's: uv installs just the changed packages and warmup re-verifies with the models already on disk, so models are never downloaded again.
- **Native window, no Terminal.** pywebview 6.2.1 (Cocoa/WKWebView, pinned with its pyobjc deps in requirements.txt) shows the UI; uvicorn runs on a thread in the same process. Closing the window ends the process, which stops the server and any running job. `ALLOW_DOWNLOADS` is on so the SRT/vocals links open a save dialog; `private_mode=False` keeps theme and language picks between launches. The bash script `exec`s Python, so the Dock and menu bar show the app's name and icon.
- **Single instance.** `launcher.py` holds an `flock` on `app.lock` (with its PID). A second copy activates that PID and POSTs `/api/focus` (un-minimizes the window via `app.on_focus_request`), then exits. Port already taken (e.g. `start.command` running) → the window says so with Try again.
- **`VERSION` file is the single source of the version number.** app.py serves it in `/api/meta` (shown in the footer meta line as "Local audio tool · vX"), make_release.sh refuses a version argument that doesn't match it and stamps it into Info.plist.
- **Update check (owner-approved exception to "no cloud calls at runtime").** `/api/update` asks `api.github.com/repos/brightlifecreations-projects/song-srt-generator/releases/latest` once per app run (4 s timeout) and the UI shows an "Update available" banner linking to the release page if its tag is newer. Any failure — offline, rate limit, no releases — returns no banner and isn't cached. It sends no app data. `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES = False` in config.py turns it off. Links with `target="_blank"` open in the default browser.
- **App icon:** `macapp/AppIcon.icns`, built by `macapp/make_icon.py` (Pillow + iconutil). *Updated 2026-10-31:* the original drawn indigo icon was replaced by Aman's artwork, `macapp/icon-source.png` (1024 px rounded square on black corners). The script makes the corners transparent using the artwork's own anti-aliased edge (no dark fringe), repairs the darkened outer 2 px ring of the source, and places it on Apple's grid (824 px inside 1024, soft shadow) so it matches other Dock icons. The same artwork, edge to edge at 128 px, is the browser favicon (`frontend/public/favicon.png`, replacing `favicon.svg`).
- **Unsigned, so Gatekeeper asks once per downloaded version:** double-click → "Apple could not verify…" → Done → System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**. Ad-hoc signing was not used: it wouldn't avoid that prompt, and any later change to a signed bundle reads as "damaged" with no Open Anyway escape. The README and the zip's read-me carry the steps.
- **Known limit:** config.py is inside the read-only bundle, so the Mac app always runs with the shipped defaults.

## V3.8 — Transcribe mode, video input, speech (2026-10-31)

- **Amends the "never transcribes" principle.** A second mode, **Transcribe for me**, sits beside **I have the lyrics/script**. Whisper only *drafts* the text; the user reads and corrects it, and only the approved text is timed, with the same forced alignment as lyrics mode. Subtitles therefore still match text a person signed off on. Lyrics mode is unchanged and never transcribes.
- **Two-phase API.** `POST /api/transcribe` runs up to the draft (status `"draft"`, with `draft_text`, `detected_language(_name)`, `script_note`); `POST /api/jobs/{id}/approve` aligns the approved text and writes the SRT. Approving again after edits is allowed (status `draft`, `done` or `error`). `GET /api/jobs/{id}/audio` serves the job's audio (extracted from a video if needed) to the waveform player while the draft is being checked. One worker queue runs every phase, so jobs stay one at a time.
- **Pipeline split** into `start_job` (validate, job folder, extract a video's sound, isolate vocals for songs) → `run_transcription` → `align_and_write`. Vocals are isolated once and reused by every approve. `run_pipeline` is the lyrics flow built from the same pieces. Job folders gain `transcript-draft.txt`. CLI: `python pipeline.py --transcribe <audio|video> [language] [song|speech]`.
- **Transcription uses the alignment model** (faster-whisper `MODEL_SIZE`), so nothing extra downloads, with `condition_on_previous_text=False` (otherwise Whisper loops on sung choruses), `beam_size=5` and Whisper's default temperature fallback. It runs on the CPU (CTranslate2 converts the float16 model to float32 there). Measured on an M4 Pro: English speech ≈ 0.6× the audio length, an English song ≈ 0.5× after vocal isolation, Hindi 3–8× (a 20 s Hindi clip took 173 s; a 3.6-min Hindi song took 13 min). The UI message says so.
  - *Faster settings rejected:* on 75 s of the Hindi song's vocals, `beam_size=1` + temperature 0 took 26 s instead of 51 s but dropped lines and produced gibberish; `beam_size=1` with fallback took 179 s and was also worse. On English the faster settings gave identical text at about half the time, but the Hindi damage decided it: quality over speed.
- **Silence check before transcribing:** `ffmpeg volumedetect`; a max level under −60 dB fails at once with "This file is silent…". Without it a silent 25 s webcam clip spent 158 s in Whisper retries before reporting no words.
- **Auto-detect language** (`"auto"`) added to `config.LANGUAGES`; it's the transcribe-mode default (`TRANSCRIBE_LANGUAGE`), while lyrics mode still defaults to `LANGUAGE`. Each mode remembers its own pick (`srt-language` / `srt-language-transcribe`). On approve, Auto-detect reuses the language transcription detected.
- **Hindi/Hinglish scripts — tested, not assumed.** Aman's "Kabhi Kabhi Aditi" vocal stem transcribed three ways: Auto-detect → **Urdu**, in Urdu script; `hi` → Devanagari, mostly right for the first half, then degrading (later lines include junk like "Easter", "charger,内"); `en` (what Hinglish meant for alignment) → **a mix**: mostly an English *translation*, with a few lines in Roman Hindi. No setting gives reliable Roman-script Hindi. So Hinglish *transcribes* as `hi` (`TRANSCRIBE_ALIASES`) and the draft is Devanagari; if the approved text is still mostly non-Latin with Hinglish selected, it aligns as `hi`, otherwise as `en` (V3.5). Auto-detect often hears Hindi as Urdu. `script_note()` tells the user in each case (retype in Roman letters for Hinglish, or pick Hindi instead of Auto-detect).
- **Video input:** MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM up to `MAX_VIDEO_UPLOAD_MB = 4096` (audio stays at 500 MB). ffmpeg extracts only the sound into the job folder; the video itself isn't kept. A video without an audio stream fails with "This video has no sound track…".
- **Content type Song / Speech** (both modes). Speech skips vocal isolation (step reads "Prepare audio") and caps every cue at `MAX_CUE_SECONDS_SPEECH = 7.0` seconds, split at balanced word boundaries on top of the character caps. Songs aren't time-capped (a held note can be long).
- Verified 2026-10-31 (first pass): warmup.py PASS (4 cues); through the API, the sample song (WAV, Auto-detect → English, draft word-for-word correct) and the same audio as an MP4 with Speech each went transcribe → approve → 4-cue SRT; re-approving an edited draft followed the edits; a video with no audio failed cleanly; lyrics mode gave its usual 4 cues.
- **Quality test (2026-10-31, full runs through the API and the UI):**

  | Input | Mode / type | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | English speech, 36 s (macOS text-to-speech, known script) | Transcribe, Speech, Auto | Detected English; draft **0 % word error**, phrase lines; 22 s transcribe, 2 s align; 34 cues ≤ 25 chars |
  | Real 30 s voiceover ad (MP4 video) | Transcribe, Speech, Auto | Detected English; draft clean apart from "Stillinga" (likely the herb Stillingia); 22 s |
  | Same MP4 | Lyrics, Speech, Horizontal | 13 cues, longest 39 chars; waveform played the extracted audio |
  | English song "1028" (3.9 min, sung dialogue) | Transcribe, Song, Auto | Detected English; draft **19 % word error** vs Aman's lyrics (≈ 81 % of words right); vocals 172 s, transcribe 106 s, align 15 s |
  | Hindi song "Kabhi Kabhi Aditi" (3.6 min) | Transcribe, Song, Hinglish | Devanagari draft + script note; first half usable, second half degrades; 13 min transcribe. Approving Aman's Roman lyrics → 106 good cues (aligned as `en`); approving the Devanagari draft as is → aligned as `hi`, same timings |
  | Hindi speech, 20 s (macOS Hindi voice) | Transcribe, Speech, Auto | Detected Hindi (not Urdu); readable Devanagari with misheard words (चोर्ते for छोटे, आवास for आवाज़); 173 s |
  | Silent 25 s webcam MOV | Transcribe, Speech | "This file is silent…" in 1.2 s |
  | Screen recording MP4 with no audio track | Transcribe | "This video has no sound track…" in 1 s |

  Vocals were isolated exactly once per song job, including after a second approval. The 7 s cap was checked separately: a 16 s unpunctuated line became cues of at most 6.4 s while staying under the character cap. The UI was driven in a pywebview window (the Mac app's engine): mode switch, Song/Speech, per-mode language defaults, read-only box until the draft, draft edit carried into the cues, Approve button, no vocals button for speech, video waveform from the extracted audio, Hinglish note, dark mode, footer attribution intact. The speech clips are synthetic, and no long real-world podcast was tested.

## Hard rules (per brief, as amended by Aman)

No Docker, no databases, no Electron, no cloud calls at runtime (one owner-approved exception: the V3.6 GitHub update check), no paid APIs, no accounts, no telemetry. App must run without any coding agent present. (The brief's original "Python + Gradio only, no React" rule was lifted by Aman for V3.)
